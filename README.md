<h1>Spotify Song Prediction Project</h1>

<h2>This project is still a work in progress</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
This project aims to predict songs other favorite songs a user likes based on their playlist that they can add. By analyzing various features such as tempo, energy, danceability, 
and more, the model can determine song characteristics that are similar to the user's 5 favorite songs.
